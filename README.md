# Description
This is a game that I am making using the Rust bevy game engin.
It is encouraged to follow along and see the file in the `docs` directory for each commit.

DISCLAIMER: It is assumed that you have a little knowledge in rust or in programming in general*. If you want to be educated in rust, go and read the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
*It is possible to understand the code if you have general programming knowledge though it would be difficult to write any.

# Preconditions
Of course, you would need rust, so go ahead and download [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
If you are on windows you will install a file that you can run, which will install `rustup`, `cargo`, `rustc` and other cool stuff, just use the defualt installation and you are good to go.

You also need `bevy` and to do that, you can do it in two ways.
1. Use the cargo tool to add bevy into your project by typing `cargo add bevy` in your terminal/cmd/powershell/whatever the hell you use for command line. The problem with this is that bevy could change drastically especially if the version of bevy in your time is very outdated.
2. Add `bevy = "0.13.1"` in your `Cargo.toml` file under `[dependencies]`. This way you will have bevy with the correct version.

# Motivation
Whenever you learn a new tool, language or a framework, you have to make a project that suits that thing. This is why I am making this game.
The reason as to why i am making it as a git project is for these reasons.
- I want to have a git repo so that I wouldn't lose my progress and also so that I want version control for the off chance I use it.
- I see that it is a really good way to learn with me, I make mistakes, change, add or delete stuff and you can see all of that, and learn with me.
- Since my game is public, it is possible for experienced people to look at my code and offer some help (THX).

Whenever you see a tutorial, you gotta make a project to learn it better, and what better way other than to learn from what I learn so come on in, go the first commit, see the commit's document in the `docs` directory.

# TODO
A game lol.
I will be following a tutorial my own and then populate this TODO with things that I have done in this project.
This section is meant to be read by people who want to learn from this repo, so you would see it as "what I will be doing if I follow along".
I do still want to add some points where I haven't made them myself and so I will be making as like a checkbox.

# Contribution
To contribute to this project, please just make an issue, I will try my best to answer as much as possible. I want to learn from you people and so it is appropriate to see issues and get more information from there. If you have a problem, you can also make an issue and I would gladly help.
